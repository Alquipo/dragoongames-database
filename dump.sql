Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old	13.99	2004-03-09	BR0	144	<h4>THE DRAGON'S LEGACY</h4>\nThe world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this "being?" deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr.\n\n<h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>\nYou, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself.<br><br>\nThat is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight.<br><br>\nThrough 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay.<br><br>\nYou will also fall under the spell of "The I of the Dragon" with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring.\n<h4>FEATURES</h4><ul><li><b>A choice of three dragons</b> each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon. There are no limits to the possibilities</li><li><b>12 unique territories</b> representing various geographical areas: mountains desserts, forests and savanna etc. Each map has over 10 square kilometers to cover</li><li>More than <b>60 spells</b> with special effects available to each dragon</li><li><b>Real time Terra-Forming</b> allows complete mountain ranges disappear and reappear in another location</li><li>Static and real-time lighting ensure the correct lighting conditions to every day and night cycle</li><li>Fascinating sunsets and a night sky full of stars await you</li><li>The Time Control-Option makes it possible to adjust "The I of The Dragon" to your own speed</li><li><b>Slow motion mode</b> with a fascinating effect</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright 2004-2015 by Primal Software Inc and TopWare Interactive AG.

Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom!

While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. \n<br><br>\nYour kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with.

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <b>AI Storyteller</b>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n<br><br><b>Your colonists are not professional settlers</b> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n<br><br><b>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</b> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\n<br><br><b>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</b> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n<br><br><b>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</b> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n<br><br><b>Travel across the planet.</b> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n<br><br><b>You can tame and train animals.</b> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n<br><br><b>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</b> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n<br><br><b>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</b> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n<br><br><b>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</b> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n<br><br><br>\n(All non-English translations are made by fans.)\n\n\n\n            \n    	\N	\N	2021-06-15 19:28:36.72+00	2021-06-15 19:28:36.813+00	2021-06-15 19:28:36.72+00

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds.

Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.<br><br>\nYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.<br><br>\nLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.<br><br>\nExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board.

To claim the fabled Crown of Command. With them come the legions of evil dragons, harnessing the awesome powers of their dark masters. Now the land quakes beneath their oppressive rule, and the quest for the Crown is more terrifying and dangerous than ever before!”</i><br><br>\nThe Dragon Expansion introduces a whole host of new mechanics including two new Inner Regions. Get ready for your Talisman experience to be taken to a whole new level as you prepare yourself to battle the Dragon Lords.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/talisman/talisman_-_the_dragon_expansion/TDE_Dragon_Banner01_Board.png"><br><br>\nDiscover the new Inner Regions: The Dragon Realm and The Dragon Tower. These new Inner Regions replace the encounters and victory objectives from the main game board. Before the game starts you can decide which side of the board you want to play with.\n<br><br>\nThe Dragon Realm has a similar set up to the normal board but boasts a number of difficult challenges as the number of dragon scales increase. Within the Dragon Realm you do not roll the die, instead you move one space at a time, following the directions the board gives until you confront the Dragon King.\n<br><br>\nThe Dragon Tower has a single path that leads to the Crown of Command, in which characters move along the spiralling staircase by drawing cards from the Dragon King’s Deck. When moving through the Dragon Tower you do not roll the die, instead you move one space per turn plus an additional space for each Enemy you kill.\n<br><br>\nThese Inner Regions are not for the faint hearted as you must encounter almost every space. Make sure you’re prepared before crossing through the Portal of Power. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/talisman/talisman_-_the_dragon_expansion/TDE_Dragon_Banner02_Dragon.png"><h4>Draconic Lord Cards &amp; Dragon Cards</h4>The three Dragon Lords, Varthrax, Grilipus and Cadorus, have returned to the land of Talisman. Each Dragon has a special ability called Dragon Rage, as well as having a dedicated Dragon deck. Each Deck consists of 56 cards featuring new Events, Enemies, Strangers, Objects, Followers and Places. Dragon cards run the risk of a character encountering a stronger than normal enemy, but the rewards you may gain are also of greater value.<h4>Dragon Tokens, Sleep Tokens &amp; Crown Token</h4>At the start of each of their turns, a player will draw a Dragon token at random. Dragon tokens are split into Special Effects and Dragon Scales.<h4>Special Effects:</h4><b>Dragon Strike:</b> The player who draws the Dragon Strike token will draw two additional dragon tokens and resolve them in the order they are drawn.  \n<br><br><b>Dragon Slumber:</b> The character who draws the Dragon Slumber token places a sleep token on a Dragon of their choice on the board in any region. If there are no Dragons on the board the token may be placed on any enemy on the board.\n<br><br><b>Dragon Rage:</b> Dragon Rage is encountered when a player draws a Dragon Rage token on their turn. The effects differ depending on which Dragon is currently King: \n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Varthraxl requires you to discard 1 Follower.

If you do not have any Objects you will lose a life. </li></ul><br>\nThese tokens are always discarded after their effects have been resolved.\n<br><br><b>Dragon Scales:</b><br>\nThe effects of dragon scales vary depending on whether they’re placed on a Draconic Lord, the game board, or taken by a character.\n<br><br>\nWhen a dragon scale is first drawn it is placed onto the matching Draconic Lord Card, once a dragon lord has had 3 scales placed on it, that Dragon becomes the Dragon King. When a Dragon becomes the King, one of its Tokens is placed onto the Space the character that drew the token is on. The other two tokens are discarded. Play continues as such and the Dragon King will change frequently. \n<br><br>\nDragon Scales can be claimed by characters if they defeat an enemy dragon. Claiming dragon scales offers characters two powerful effects:\n<br>\nIf a character encounters an Enemy or Draconic Lord, each dragon scale the character has that matches his opponent adds one point to his attack score.\n<br>\nIf a character is about to suffer Dragon Rage they may discard one dragon token that matched the Dragon Lords to cancel the effects.\n<br><br>\nOnce a player reaches the Crown of Command, the Dragon King cannot change. The first one to defeat the Dragon king wins.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/talisman/talisman_-_the_dragon_expansion/TDE_Dragon_Banner03_Ending.png"><h4>Dragon Slayers</h4>Varthrax, Grilipus, and Cadorus are swarming the Crown of Command. With 5 lives each it’ll be a long but valiant battle to slay the three dragons and claim the Crown. If a character loses in combat against a Dragon Lord they’ll suffer losing a life and the Dragon Rage of the dragon they were attacking. Once all the Dragons are defeated, the player with the most tokens which show they defeated a Draconic Lord wins.<h4>Dragon King</h4>The King is never someone you should challenge. Facing the Dragon King isn’t easy, once you’ve reached his lair, you’ll need to roll a die at the beginning of your turn to determine your fate.\n<br><br>\n1-2) discard a Talisman Card. If you don’t have a Talisman Card you lose a life instead. \n<br>\n3-4) Moving Clockwise around the board, all characters must attack the Dragon King using Strength or Craft. \n<br>\n5-6) Attack the Dragon King using Strength or Craft. If you have a Stand-off you are defeated.\n<br><br>\nThe character who removed the Kings last life wins, but if the Dragon King is left alone on the Crown of Command, he heals all his lives.<h4>Domain of Dragons</h4>At the start of the game one Draconic Lord Card will be drawn at random and placed faceup on the Crown of command. This will be the Dragon King for the game. Although the king won’t change, the other Dragons will do his bidding to stop you reaching him for the final battle. \n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>If a player draws an enemy with Strength the player must place a Varthrax card on top of the Adventure Card deck.\n<br></li><li>If a player draws an enemy with Craft the player must place a Gilipus card on top of the Adventure Card deck.\n<br></li><li>If a player draws an Object the player must place a Codorus card on top of the Adventure Card deck.\n<br></li><li>Whenever a character kills an Enemy from a Dragon Card they may claim the matching dragon scale. \n<br></li><li>Whenever a Character is instructed to draw a dragon token they suffer the King’s Dragon Rage instead. \n<br></li><li>The Character who removes the Dragon King’s last life wins. </li></ul><h4>Challenge for the Crown</h4>The journey to the Dragon King is a long and difficult one. You must reach the Crown of Command as per the normal rules, but when you arrive there you are teleported to the Dragon Tower. Your final assent to confront the Dragon King start here. Vanquish him and win the game.<h4>Confront the Dragon King</h4>Attack the Dragon King head on in a battle to the death! As you enter the Crown of Command choose to attack the Dragon King through Strength or Craft and attack immediately. If you survive, take one of the lives from the Dragon King and attack him again. If you have a stand-off or you’re defeated your turn ends. You’ll lose a life and suffer the effects of the Dragon King’s Dragon Rage.\n<br>\nYour next turn sees you attack the King again until either you or he loses all lives.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/talisman/talisman_-_the_dragon_expansion/TDE_Dragon_Banner04_Characters.png"><h4>Dragon Rider</h4>Dragon Riders have a close and unique bond with their dragons. This bond allows them to gain advantages as they travel through the land of Talisman. When playing as the Dragon Rider:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Whenever you engage a Dragon in battle or psychic combat, add 3 to your attack roll. \n<br></li><li>If you defeat a Dragon you may capture it and take it as a Follower instead of a Trophy. You may only have one captured Dragon at a time. While you have a captured Dragon you gain the following benefits: \n<br></li><li>After you roll the die for your move, you may add up to 3 to the score. \n<br></li><li>You may roll two dice in battle and psychic combat and use the higher attack roll to determine your attack score. </li></ul><h4>Fire Wizard</h4>As the Dragons reached the land of Talisman, the Fire Wizard focused his training into fire magic, to counter the Dragons’ attacks. This lead him to create an immensely powerful Pyroblast ability and withstand the most powerful of dragon attacks. When playing as the Fire Wizard:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>At the start of your turn you may gain 1 Spell if your Craft allows.\n<br></li><li>You may hurl a Pyroblast whenever you are about to engage in battle with a character or creature. Roll one die and add your Craft. If the score is higher than the characters Strength, they must lose one life. If the score is higher than the creature’s Strength, it is killed. Enemies killed may not be taken as trophies. If the score is equal to or lower than the character or Creatures Strength, the Pyroblast has no effect and the battle is resolved normally expect you may not roll a die for your attack roll. \n<br></li><li>You are not affected by dragons breath attacks. </li></ul><h4>Conjurer</h4>As the land fills up with snarling dragons, traveling has become more treacherous than ever before. The Conjurer is able to manipulate the cards on the board and avoid encountering a dragon before she’s ready for battle! When playing as the Conjurer:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You begin the game with 1 Spell and you always have at least 1 Spell.\n<br></li><li>You may conjure whenever you encounter a space with instructions to draw more than one adventure card. If the space does not already any adventure cards you may move a faceup Adventure Card in the same region to your space.</li></ul><h4>Dragon Hunter</h4>As the land has become tormented by Varthrax, Grilipus, and Cadorus, the Dragon Hunter has taken it upon himself to hone his hunting skills to hunt dragons. No Dragon is safe from him or his trusty Axe. When playing as the Dragon Hunter:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You begin the game with an Axe. \n<br></li><li>Instead of rolling a die for movement you may move to the closest Dragon on another space in your Region.\n<br></li><li>Whenever you engage an Enemy in battle, you may make a deathblow. Roll two dice and add them together to determine your attack roll. If you make a deathblow and roll doubles you are automatically defeated regardless of your attack.</li></ul><h4>Minotaur</h4>The sounds of battle have brought the Minotaur out of his maze. He powerfully charges down his foes and leaves ruin in his wake! When playing as the Minotaur:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Whenever you are about to engage in battle during your turn you may stampede and add the result of your movement die to your Strength until the end of the battle.\n<br></li><li>You may not use any armour. </li></ul><h4>Dragon Priestess</h4>Unlike the other adventures, the Dragon Priestess saw the pure power and abilities of the Dragon Kings and their subjects. Since their arrival, she has devoted her life to these majestic creatures. When playing as the Dragon Priestess:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You begin the game with 2 Spells.\n<br></li><li>Whenever you encounter a Cultist, you may take it as a Follower instead of attacking it. \n<br></li><li>After rolling the die when praying you may use all, none, or some of your followers to perform a ritual. Each follower is used in the ritual adds 1 to your score. \n<br></li><li>Whenever your encounter a Dragon, you may offer a sacrifice instead of attacking. Discard one of your Followers, Objects of Spells and roll two dice to pray with the same results as the temple.\n<br></li><li>You are not affected by Dragon Rage.</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/talisman/talisman_-_the_dragon_expansion/TDE_Dragon_Banner05_Expansion.png"><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>138 Dragon Cards\n<br></li><li>New Inner Region Board\n<br></li><li>Dragon Tokens\n<br></li><li>6 Characters\n<br></li><li>5 Alternative Endings </li></ul><br><i>“Can you reach the Crown of Command and vanquish the Dragon King?”</i><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Talisman © Games Workshop Limited 1983, 1985, 1994, 2007.

With Dorfromantik, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the highscore, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/banner_gameplay_english2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p><br>\nIn Dorfromantik you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/mp4/Gameplay.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br>\nOn some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape.&nbsp;The game ends when the tile stack is used up.\n<br><br>\nAs you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/mp4/TopDown_3.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/banner_features_english2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p><h4>What Dorfromantik offers</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Building endless and beautiful landscapes\n<br></li><li>Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics\n<br></li><li>Relaxing and calming gameplay\n<br></li><li>Idyllic village scenery\n<br></li><li>Strategic placement to beat the highscore\n<br></li><li>High replay value - every session is different\n<br></li><li>Many unlockable tiles and biomes\n<br></li><li>Original Artstyle with handpainted boardgame feel</li></ul><h4>What Dorfromantik does <b>not </b>offer</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>4X Strategy\n<br></li><li>Trading\n<br></li><li>Resource Management\n<br></li><li>Combat &amp; Violence\n<br></li><li>Multiplayer</li></ul><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/banner_team_english2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p><br>\nDorfromantik was developed by four game design students from Berlin.

237	Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut	shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut	NOTE: The Director’s Cut is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone r	27.99	2014-09-17	BR0	77	\n    \n    \n    \n            NOTE: The Director’s Cut is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns.\n<br><br>\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.\n<br><br>\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\n<br><br>\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\n<br><br>\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\n<br><br><b>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features:</b><br><br><b>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG</b>: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\n<br><br><b>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting</b>: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\n<br><br><b>Command Your Team</b>: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\n<br><br><b>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat</b>: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.\n<br><br><b>Skill-Based Character Progression</b>: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\n<br><br><b>New in the Director’s Cut:</b><br><br><b>Standalone</b>: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!\n<br><br><b>Five All-New Missions</b>: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.\n<br><br><b>Revamped Combat System</b>: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.\n<br><br>\nRedesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.\n<br><br><b>Customize Your Team</b>: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.\n<br><br><b>Ten New Pieces of Original Music</b>: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.\n<br><br><b>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack</b>: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment. \n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2014 Harebrained Holdings, Inc.

Discover the many secrets beneath the ancient digital landscape, and prepare for system-wide reconfiguration.\n<br><br>\nThe game's entire narrative takes place within 1 second of real time.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/recompile/EXPLORE.gif"><br>\nDelve into the ancient, sprawling ruins of the Mainframe and discover a range of traversal abilities to help you on your journey towards attaining true sapience.\n<br><br>\nRecompile aims to be the first ever Metroidvania-style game to include multiple, highly dynamic critical paths. Your play style and choices matter, weaving together a narrative unique to you as the true nature of the mysterious virtual world is revealed.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/recompile/FIGHT.gif"><br>\nThe untimely fall of the Seven Suns lead to a millenia of neglect, gradually transforming the Mainframe's vast repository of code into a race of half-sentient, half-deterministic subroutines. They exist in a state of flux, as if trapped by their programming in a kind of twisted digital purgatory.\n<br><br>\nYou, The Program, must decide on whether to help or hinder the denizens of the Mainframe. The inhabitants are strange and diverse, and many are found to be inherently hostile. A full complement of powerful weapons and abilities are available to help you survive, defend and destroy.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/recompile/HACK.gif"><br>\nEvery single environmental feature, including power grids, locked doors and even huge enemy spawning machines are all powered by intricate, interconnected logic gate circuitry.\n<br><br>\nNothing is hardcoded, everything is systemic, and everything fully exploitable. Logic gates can be freely inverted, overridden or disabled entirely, allowing puzzles or other threatening obstacles to be peacefully and safely bypassed. Even the inhabitants themselves can be tampered with, their programming changed to follow the player's commands.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/recompile/AWAKEN.gif"><br>\nRecompile is a game about choices and consequences.\n<br><br>\nLife and death.

Despite that, in response to Diablo players who have expressed a desire to experience the content, Blizzard has given the OK for it to be included as a free add-on with Diablo purchases on GOG.COM.\n<br><br>\nHellfire offers a non-canonical single-player storyline where players must defeat a powerful demon named Na-Krul who is threatening Tristram. The expansion also adds a Monk class, new weapons and items, new missions, locations, dungeons, and enemies. Hellfire will be accessible while launching the original Diablo.</p><br><hr><br><i>Traveler, stay awhile and listen...</i><br><br>\n\nDarkness stirs beneath Tristram.\nAn ancient evil sweeps across the land, plunging it into civil war and terrorizing the populace. A mad king, his missing son, and a mysterious archbishop are all pieces of the puzzle you need to hack through.\nYou have journeyed to the source of this evil. The town of Tristram - now inhabited only by a handful of survivors, broken and twisted by the madness that has befallen them. A cathedral stands there, built over the ruins of an ancient monastery. Eerie lights and ungodly sounds are heard echoing through its abandoned halls, and that is where you shall venture.<br><br><i>Embark, if you dare, on a quest to destroy The Prime Evil…</i><br><br><ul><li>Experience the legendary action/RPG that influenced an entire genre.</li><li>Storm Diablo's halls as either a Warrior, a Sorcerer or a Rogue - each with unique skills and abilities.</li><li>Unite to destroy Diablo - up to 4 players can band together via Internet, or play head-to-head via LAN.</li><li>Unprecedented replayability - over 200 different monsters inhabit Diablo's ever-changing labyrinth.

This pack of entrancing horrors includes Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession and its sequel, Ravenloft: Stone Prophet\n<br><br><b>Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession</b><br><i>Cordial Greetings from Count Strahd Von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia</i><br><br>\nFor many travellers, I have naught but contempt and slight regard, entering Barovia as they do in timid apprehension of her wonders. They are neither prepared for life high in the Balinoks, nor ready to accept its dangers. Here, the peaks of Baratak and Ghakis stand in cloaks of granite, their cowls of snow pulled securely about them as if they alone might endure the ancient night. \n<br><br>\nHowever, your party intrigues me. Perhaps the harsh cut of the wind or a storm in the forest does not alarm you. If that is so, I am certain our woods, streams and caverns will attract your interest, offering many a delightful diversion. Even the otherwise abysmal village of Barovia boasts a charming cemetery. You must visit it. Perhaps, if your party survives... that is, stays long enough in this harsh and unyielding home of mine, I may require its presence. I shall ask you to join me in Ravenloft, my castle upon the precipice overlooking Barovia. It is not an invitation to be refused. \n<br><br>\nI give my leave for your party to enjoy our misty, twilight dangers. Let you challenge your wits and fighting skills; may the perilous magics of my land enchant them. But heed this warning and do not play at cross-purposes with me. To stand against Strahd is to be at odds with life itself, for he who sends these greetings is the Lord and the Law of this brutal paradise.\n<br><br>\nWith Gentle Regards, <br><img src="http://items.gog.com/hasbeen/Signature_2.png" style="float: left; width: 220px"><span style="display: block; height: 10px"></span><br><i>Count Strahd Von Zarovich<br>\nLord of Barovia</i><br><br><b>Ravenloft: Stone Prophet </b><br><br>\nThe desert of Har'Akir is ancient beyond belief. Not all of its past is marked by noble deeds and great kings. In ancient days, the evil pharaoh Anhktepot ruled a great and powerful nation. His downfall stemmed from his desire for immortality. Cursed by Ra, the sun god, Anhktepot's soul still remains in his mummified form and brings death to those it touches at night. \n<br><br>\nStone Prophet, begins when your characters become trapped in a wasteland haunted by unnatural creatures, fierce sand storms, and cursed villagers afflicted by a horrible rotting disease. Your party's only hope of escape is to follow the advice of a blind seer and seek out the Stone Prophet, a huge, hieroglyphic wall hidden deep within a mysterious obelisk. Some say the writings on the wall, when deciphered, may lead the party to freedom... or to death. One thing is certain, a great conflict has been foreseen, and the mummy lord is gathering his forces.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Enjoy the lore and depth of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure in a gothic and Egyptian setting</li><li class="description__features-point">Assemble your party and make your way across terrain and through dungeons, using weaponry, magic, brains and brawn   </li><li class="description__features-point">Fight a wide array of horrific creatures and rid Barovia and Har'Akir of the evil manifestations</li></ul>	\N	\N	2021-08-21 04:02:56.084+00	2021-08-21 04:02:56.14+00	2021-08-21 04:02:55.61+00

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Use all the wicked spells, feats, and prestige classes from the D&amp;D 3.5 rules. Create your characters any way you wish, choosing from a wide variety of races and subraces, such as Tiefling and Aasimar.

The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren’t made in the very near future. <br><br>\n\nRean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial Nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply embedded into the hearts of every Erebonian since the days of old.

For the first time in the prestigious academy’s history, rank means nothing and skill means everything.

Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete.\n<br><br>\nBrave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware "study" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game.\n<br><br>\nAs George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/brave_earth_prologue/pub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\nThis is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. \n<br><br>\nI’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. \n<br><br>\nKayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. \n<br><br>\nIn Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge.\n<br><br>\nIt’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least.\n<br><br>\nI couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2017 Dangen Entertainment.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view.\n<br><br>\nA big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_gif_fight.gif"><br><br><b>Modular stations and ship upgrades:</b><br><br>\nBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations.\n<br><br>\nShips also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_gif_docking.gif"><br><br><b>Most dynamic X universe ever:</b><br><br>\nX4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_x4_store_banner_02.png"><br><b>Managing your empire with a powerful map:</b><br><br>\nOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands.\n<br><br>\nGraphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.\n<br><br><br><b>Most detailed X economy ever:</b><br><br>\nOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.\n<br><br><br><b>Research and Teleportation:</b><br><br>\nThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.\n<br><br>\nEvery order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.\n<br><br><br><b>Get into the game:</b><br><br>\nIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with.

Import your character from the main campaign to the moment of their greatest triumph — their victory over the Worldwound. Answer a plea from a powerful entity and leave Golarion behind to defend the space-time continuum against imminent collapse. Use your unparalleled mythic powers to do battle with truly invincible opponents. This additional campaign offers 7–8 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #2:</h4>\nNew additional campaign. The demon attack on Kenabres changed the lives of many. While the mythic hero and their loyal companions were busy liberating the city, the common folk had to find a way to survive, relying only on their humble skills.\nBand together with other survivors and try to reach the Defender's Heart tavern, the last foothold of the crusader forces in the city. Choose who will join your group, and make difficult decisions about allocating scarce resources. Remember — in fire-ravaged Kenabres, every scroll and potion could make the difference not only in an individual fight but also to your very survival. Act in the group's best interests or focus solely on your own well-being. Import your choices to the main campaign and look forward to seeing this story develop in other DLC. This additional campaign offers 6–7 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #3:</h4>\nA new rogue-like mode with partial integration into the main campaign. In Alushinyrra's port, climb aboard a cursed ship that will transport you to a mysterious whirlpool lost amidst the Midnight Isles. Dive in and discover a dungeon whose proportions you can only guess at. Go exploring in search of glory, loot, and battles, and come face to face with a secret that will benefit either Nocticula, the mistress of the archipelago, or her enemies. The dungeon's levels, created using random zone generation, are populated with various enemies, devious traps, and secret rooms. You will return victorious to Alushinyrra — or else the cursed ship will return on its own, laden with trophies from the last expedition, to await new adventure-seekers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n            \n    	\N	\N	2021-08-19 21:40:09.206+00	2021-08-19 21:40:09.234+00	2021-08-19 21:40:09.206+00

You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

With that question, let us introduce you to the world of <b>Spindle</b> where indeed nobody dies anymore. And the answer to the question is rather simple: Chaos. Pure disorder.

Grab your scythe, ask your little pig-friend to join the journey and let's go adventuring.\n<br><br><b>Spindle</b> is an oldschool zeldaesque experience where you slip into the role of Death.

The commander explains tersely, "It's about the Slipgate device. Once we perfect these, we'll be able to use them to transport people and cargo from one place to another instantly. An enemy codenamed Quake, is using his own slipgates to insert death squads inside our bases to kill, steal, and kidnap. The hell of it is we have no idea where he's from. Our top scientists think Quake's not from Earth, but another dimension. They say Quake's preparing to unleash his real army, whatever that is.\n<br><br><i>"You're our best man.

He heard about Operation Counterstrike, and hit first. Racing back, you see the place is overrun. You are almost certainly the only survivor. Operation Counterstrike is over. Except for you. You know that the heart of the installation holds a slipgate. Since Quake's killers came through, it is still set to his dimension. You can use it to get loose in his hometown. Maybe you can get to the asshole personally. You pump a round into your shotgun, and get moving."\n<br><br>\nFrom the masterminds behind DOOM and Wolfenstein comes an FPS classic that will warp your world. Building on the successful elements that drew players to DOOM, Quake brings a more Gothic flavour to the FPS genre and, like its predecessor, has spawned copycats and sequels over the years. The game is also renowned for creating and popularising Machinima, as the game engine was used to create Machinima classic’s such as “The Diary of a Camper” and “The Seal of Nehahra”. This GOG release also contains the two expansions for this first installment, “Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon” and “Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity”, bringing even more interdimensional horrors and weapons to your PC.

ARE YOU MAD?:</h4>Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we’ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn’t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once.

There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and…\n<br></li><li><b>Skins</b>: People have been requesting this for ages and we’ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accomadate the request.

They founded farms, raised cattle, dug for gold, built settlements and towns. \n<br><br>\nA small find of gold is often enough to draw hundreds of daring adventurers while quickly a small settlement becomes a flourishing town with saloons, merchants, gambling, adventurers, and gunslingers... \n<br><br>\nEnter this breathtakingly exciting time and conquer the Wild West. Emerge from being a lonesome cowboy over founding a settlement to becoming the mayor of a gold-digger town: there are hardly any limits to your personal endeavors. \n<br><br>\nYou start out as a lonesome cowboy who comes across an abandoned ranch and decides to stay. You start repairing and expanding. You gather food, hunt for animals and sell their meat and leather to settler trecks. Once you have established a decent ranch, other settlers may decide to stay and ask for permission to settle down. You start building a town with all its classic locations such as saloon, Sheriff office, stores and even hotels. Bandits will come your way, so you better learn shooting and defend yourself and the township properly. Hopefully you will find a wife and have a heir - so that your wild west dynasty can last for long.\n<br><br><b>Features:</b><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Realistic Wild West atmosphere played in First Person mode\n<br></li><li>Story mode with interesting twists and hundreds of missions included\n<br></li><li>Free game: Build a town without Story mode\n<br></li><li>Create your own Dynasty which will last for decades\n<br></li><li>Open 3D world set in the Wild West \n<br></li><li>Start as a settler, build your own ranch and expand it to a prosperous town\n<br></li><li>Unique mix of RPG (First Person), Life Simulation and town building\n<br></li><li>Horse riding included\n<br></li><li>Detailed skill development tree\n<br></li><li>Various additional possibilities like gold mining, rodeo riding etc included</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Wild West Dynasty ©2021 Toplitz Productions GmbH.

The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies – both mythical and historical. This time around, it’s not the band of brothers that’s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br><h4>STORY</h4>\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n            \n    	\N	\N	2021-06-15 19:32:09.78+00	2021-06-15 19:32:09.86+00	2021-06-15 19:32:09.78+00

You might think that this job is mostly digging holes and dusting old bones. How could a game about that possibly be fun? Well, Lara Croft is anything but an ordinary archaeologist and her life is anything but boring. Lara Croft, tomb raider, occupies an interesting niche between Indiana Jones and Bayonetta: she’s a relic hunter who can kick butt and take names with the best of them.\n<br><br>\nWhen Lara ventures into ancient tombs in search for legendary treasures and forgotten knowledge, she must keep in mind that those responsible for safeguarding those artifacts didn’t leave them unguarded. The tombs are filled with deadly traps, bizarre monsters, and clever puzzles. Lara is not all looks, though, so she’s ready for the dangers that await. At her disposal is an arsenal of weapons from twin pistols, through all kinds of machine guns and assault rifles, all the way to grenade launchers and bazookas.\n<br><br>\nIn the first game, Lara seeks a powerful artifact--the Scion--that seems to be the key to finding the mythical island of Atlantis. In the second game of the series our sexy archaeologist follows the trial of the mystical Dagger of Xian, which is a weapon used by the first Emperor of China, and it is said that by plunging the dagger into one's heart, the bearer turns into a dragon. The third part features non-linear gameplay, meaning you can choose not only the way in which you complete a level, but also your next destination in the story. Here, you fight against an evil corrupt corporation--RX Tech-- that has come into possession of a strange meteorite apparently imbued with unique properties.\n<br><br>\nFans of action platformers, great stories, and timeless classics: good news!

Explore and conquer the Stolen Lands and make them your kingdom!\n<br><br>\n\nExplore the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom! To do so, you’ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_010.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br>\n\nCustomize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats.

You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours.

While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. \n<br><br>\nYour kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with.

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n\n            \n    	\N	\N	2021-06-15 19:32:09.634+00	2021-06-15 19:32:09.712+00	2021-06-15 19:32:09.634+00

But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.\n<br><br><i>Bad North</i> is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite.

You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n<br><br>\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the <i>Bad North</i>.\n<br><br><h2><b>Key Features:</b></h2><br><b>REAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE: </b> Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose.

Lo Wang is Shadow Warrior. #1 Assassin. #1 Yakuza abuser. #1 Freak fragger. #1 Mutant mutilator. #1 Reason to be scared of the dark. Enter the Land of the Rising Sun and spread ninja charisma like napalm for there are undead sumos to be uzied, samurai to be shurikened, and bulldozers to be boarded. Don’t forget to goose the geishas and make sure your dinghy isn’t hanging out...\n<br><br>\nFrom the creators of Duke Nukem 3D, comes the ever-explosive, forever controversial Shadow Warrior, a first-person shooter that takes the Build engine to its extreme limits.

You will take the role of a Vault-dweller, a person who has grown up in a secluded, underground survival Vault.

You must find Vault 13 and claim the technology that your tribe needs to survive. If you fail in this quest - your tribe will surely die. You must travel the perilous Wastes on a holy quest to find Vault 13. The same Vault that cruelly cast your grandsire out into the Wastes 80 years ago. The Vault owes you. The Vault owes your tribe. Now it's time to collect.\n\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">One of the best cRPGs ever created; what more could you need?!</li><li class="description__features-point">A vast, post-apocalyptic world full of mysteries and countless ways to solve them</li><li class="description__features-point">An immersive and truly non-linear storyline</li></ul>	\N	\N	2021-08-19 23:59:15.24+00	2021-08-19 23:59:15.255+00	2021-08-19 23:59:15.24+00

It contains the game Road 96, its OST and a game book that tells the story prior to the game.<br><br><b>Road 96</b><br>\nRoad 96 is a crazy, beautiful road-trip. The discovery of exciting places, and unusual people on your own personal journey to freedom.<br><br>\nAn ever-evolving story-driven adventure inspired by Tarantino, The Coen Brothers, and Bong Joon-ho. Made by the award-winning creators of Valiant Hearts and Memories Retold. Announced as part of the OMEN Presents initiative from HP Inc.<br><br>\nMoments of action, exploration, contemplative melancholy, human encounters and wacky situations. Set against a backdrop of authoritarian rule and oppression.<br><br>\nA stunning visual style, a soundtrack filled with 90s hits, and a thousand routes through the game combine so each player can create their own unique stories on Road 96.<br><br><b>The Road 96: Prologue game book</b><br>\nMuch like the acclaimed book series of the 80s and 90s, it offers the reader to experience a literary adventure where you choose your path to adventure.<br><br>\nRoad 96: Prologue takes place in the Road 96 video game universe – 10 years before the events of the game, to be specific. You do not need to play Road 96 to appreciate the book, or vice-versa, but the two bodies or work align, and they complement one another. Therefore you should expect to recognize places, events, and characters, and you will expand your knowledge of Petria.<br><br><b>The Road 96 OST</b><br>\nA collection of evocative, nostalgia-laced tracks, that express where you are on your journey, by some of the most talented and well-regarded names in music. A blend of folk, pop, dance music, and electronica songs that stay with you long after you’ve finished the game.<br>\nFeel the wide-open road, the peaceful landscapes, the broad skies, the colorful locals, moments of danger, a sense of wonder and the ever-changing world around you.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Road 96 is a trademark from Digixart Entertainment.\n        </p>	\N	\N	2021-08-19 23:59:13.702+00	2021-08-19 23:59:13.751+00	2021-08-19 23:59:13.702+00
